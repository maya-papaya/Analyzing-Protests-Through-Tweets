# Analyzing Protests Through Tweets

In our modern society, protests are a way to collectively unite our voices to create change. However, some protests can negatively impact communities (looting, riots) or just be a nuisance (blocking traffic). Other times, people focus on the protesters' actions, rather than the message they're trying to spread (for example, the climate activists who threw soup at a famous painting). I wanted to find out how we can effectively share our voices through protests and gain support.

This project is meant to explore public sentiment toward protests by analyzing tweets.
